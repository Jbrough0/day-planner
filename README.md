# day-planner
I created time blocks to show that I begin work at 8 in the morning and finish at 4 in the afternoon I used moment to show exacly what time it is when you open my webpege.  I created text areas so that the user is able to type in an event.  Although I was having trouble getting the save buttons to work I did have them saved in local storage.  I also color coded the webpage so that past hours are grey the current hour is red and future hours are green.
